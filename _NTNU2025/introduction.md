# Introduction to Google Earth Engine

The following sections are intended to support the short introduction to Google Earth Engine (GEE) delivered to the students of the Department of Life Sciences at NTNU (Fall 2025).

This half-day lecture is partly based on the week-long introduction to GEE delivered to the students of University of Parakou in Spring 2025 as part of the [OBSYDYA project](https://www.obsydya.org/).
